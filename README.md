work in progress...  
<br/>
I'm using a Marantz amplifier at home to listen radio.  
Early 2024, some stations (e.g.: [RadioFrance](https://mediateur.radiofrance.com/actualites/lecoute-de-radio-france-via-tunein/))
 became unavaible in TuneIn which Marantz rely on to play radio.  
<br/>
This project is a mobile application that allows you to play any station and set one as alarm.
